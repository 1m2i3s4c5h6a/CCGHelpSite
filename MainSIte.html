    <h3>What is CCG?</h3>
    <p>CCG is a 2D action game, created in September 2024 in Germany by 'ptand1133.'
    It is available on the Microsoft Store.
    </p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>The game is about evil food that wants to infect people with a virus.
    The virus can transform people into food.
    The cutlery is also infected with this virus, but instead of attacking the world,
    they decide to save it from the evil food.</p>

    <h3>How to play</h3>
    <p>To start the game, click the left button 'Play,' then click the middle button 'Start.'</p>

    <P>To move your character, press W, A, S, or D.</p>
    <p>
    If you want to attack an enemy, press the left mouse button.
    On the screen, you will see a red arrow above your character and a bar at the top of the screen.
    The arrow shows the direction your character will attack. You can change the direction by scrolling the middle mouse button.
    On the bar, you will see a white rectangle that moves left and right. It indicates the power of the attack.
    When you release the left mouse button, your character will attack in the direction you selected.
    The power of the attack depends on where the rectangle stops (red zone = most power; green zone = least power; yellow zone = power between the red and green zones).
